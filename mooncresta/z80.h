/*
 * Zilog Z80 CPU core.
 *
 * A port of MAME's src/devices/cpu/z80 to plain C. The instruction semantics,
 * cycle counts and flag handling (including MEMPTR and the Q latch behind the
 * SCF/CCF undocumented flags) are MAME's: the opcode bodies are generated from
 * MAME's z80.lst by tools/z80gen.py into z80_ops.h, and the helpers in z80.c
 * are MAME's z80.cpp. Dropped: the device framework, the daisy chain, BUSREQ/
 * WAIT, and the mid-instruction suspension - an instruction always runs to the
 * end, and the cycle budget is checked between instructions.
 *
 * Memory access goes through a 256-entry page table first: a non-NULL page is
 * read or written directly, anything else goes to the read/write callbacks.
 * Opcode fetches, operands, stack and data all use the same tables.
